# Tutorial Intro

The **iDempiere REST API** is a powerful plugin that allows developers to interact with an iDempiere server through a modern, RESTful interface. All data is exchanged over HTTP using JSON, making it easy to connect with any system or tool that supports web services.

This API is designed with developers in mind and follows the [OData standard](https://www.odata.org/) to ensure consistency, structure, and predictability across endpoints.
